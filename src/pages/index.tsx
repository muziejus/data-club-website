    <h1 className="font-title">Hi, Data Friends,</h1>

    <p>
      Data Club, provided by <a href="https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/">Research Data Services</a>,
      offers a series of strategic lessons and a supportive meeting space for members of the
      Columbia community of all levels to learn, share, and implement the
      philosophies, tools, and methodologies for a data-driven project of their
      choosing.
      In bi-monthly meetings, the Data Club provides a short
      instructive session, free-work time, and a collaborative and exploratory
      environment for researchers to pursue a personal project with the
      assistance of Columbia University librarians and their data-minded peers.
