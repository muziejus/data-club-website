[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is an analytical staple of the
scientific, digital humanities, industrial, financial, and tech
communities.  It is the data-science workhorse of the PyData landscape and
a powerful tool for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the process
of investigating, analyzing, and wrangling data.  We will walk through the
basic application of Pandas to an example dataset and discuss common issues
that arise when first using the library. 

This workshop is geared towards folks with little or no Python experience
who want a gentle introduction to exploring data with code.  Whether you
are first-year undergraduate, an upper-level graduate student, or somewhere
in between, this workshop is for you.
