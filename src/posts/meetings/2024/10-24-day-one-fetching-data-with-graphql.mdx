Developed by Facebook, GraphQL is a data query language that lets clients
specify exactly what data they need from a data source. This leads to
expressive queries that reveal the structure of the data at the data
source. In this workshop, we’ll learn the basics of the language as well as
using it in a JavaScript environment. 

We’ll also discuss ways to implement GraphQL on your own datastores. 

No prior programming experience is required.
