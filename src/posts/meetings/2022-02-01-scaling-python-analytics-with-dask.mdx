Starting to explore the PyData landscape (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and
friends) and hitting memory issues? Curious about open-source workflows
that will help you analyze large files locally or in the cloud? Tired of
slow `for`-loops and hoping to distribute your vectorized code onto a host of
cloud workers?

This workshop on Scaling Python Analytics with Dask is for you! We will
help you work with larger datasets that wonâ€™t fit in memory and distribute
your workloads to accelerate your code with [Dask](https://www.dask.org). You will learn to query
and transform data, build models, and scale your code. Basic knowledge of
Python is suggested.
