Do you use Python or R and want to expand your repertoire?  Are you a
newcomer to programming who wants to start at the cutting edge, a Matlab
user looking for an open-source language that won't slow you down, or a
veteran coder on the perpetual quest for a perfect programming language?

Come to Intro to Julia for Python Users, a workshop geared towards people
familiar with python who want to start working with the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org).  
We will review the many syntactical similarities between Python
and Julia and then explore important Julia concepts that help speed up
Pythonic Julia programs.  Basic knowledge of Python is suggested.
