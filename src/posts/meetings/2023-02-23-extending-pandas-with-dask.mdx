Do you have too much data to process locally? Do you want tools to probe
datasets bigger than your laptop can handle? This workshop, the second in a
two-part series on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), will introduce participants to 
[Dask Dataframe](https://www.dask.org/), a
Python library that parallelizes pandas efficient computation and lazy
processing. We will explore how Dask Dataframes operates, and use it to
reduce large datasets to manageable size. No prior programming experience
is required.
