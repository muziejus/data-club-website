Bring your curiosity and a laptop to the first Data Club of the semester,
where we’ll cover the absolute basics of Python. Aimed at people who have
never programmed before, this workshop will introduce the basic structure
of using Python in a code notebook to let participants get excited about
continuing their paths as Pythonistas.
