Are you comfortable with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and wonder how to use it with spatial data?
Have you tried using ArcGIS or QGIS but want to be “closer” your data?  Are
you new to coding and spatial data analysis and want to start with strong
fundamentals?

Come to this workshop on GeoPandas! [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) is a community-led Python
library that integrates geographic data with Pandas and [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) objects.
This workshop will provide a beginners introduction to GeoPandas.  We will
walk through examples of how to import, process, and visualize datasets in
GeoPandas. Basic knowledge of Python is suggested.
