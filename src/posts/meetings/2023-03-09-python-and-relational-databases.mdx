Typically when working with data in a Python notebook or in pandas, we rely
on the abstraction of the dataframe, a matrix of columns and rows. However,
a lot of data is still stored in relational databases like MySQL, and
lightweight databases like SQLite may help Pythonistas with their data.
Learn about relational databases and how to use them in Python.
